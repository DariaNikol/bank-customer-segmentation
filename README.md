# Bank Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project segments bank customers based on credit limits and service usage patterns to support targeted marketing and service improvements. The focus is on understanding customer behavior rather than prediction.

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer-level information such as credit limits, number of credit cards, and interaction frequency across different service channels (branch visits, online activity, and phone calls).

**Note:** The dataset is not included due to academic usage restrictions.

## Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature scaling  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- K-Means clustering  
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)  
- K-Medoids clustering  
- Cluster comparison and stability analysis  

---

## Key Insights
- Customers consistently form three segments: low-credit, mid-credit, and high-credit.
- High-credit customers rely more on digital channels.
- Low- and mid-credit customers use branches and phone support more frequently.
- Clustering results are stable across different algorithms.

## Practical Takeaways
The segmentation highlights clear differences in customer behavior, allowing the bank to tailor digital services, improve support operations, and design targeted offerings for each customer group.
